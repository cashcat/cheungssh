<h2>History<a class="headerlink" href="#history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Mod_python originates from a project called
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.modpython.org/httpdapy/">Httpdapy</a> (1997). For a
long time Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not
meant to be Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be
cross-platform and in fact was initially written for the Netscape
server (back then it was called Nsapy (1997)).</p>
<p>Nsapy itself was based on an original concept and first code by Aaron
Watters from &#8220;Internet Programming with Python&#8221; by Aaron Watters,
Guido Van Rossum and James C. Ahlstrom, ISBN 1-55851-484-8.</p>
<p>Without Aaron&#8217;s inspiration, there would be no mod_python. Quoting
from the Httpdapy README file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>Although Nsapy only worked with Netscape servers, it was very
generic in its design and was based on some brilliant ideas that
weren&#39;t necessarily Netscape specific. Its design is a combination
of extensibility, simplicity and efficiency that takes advantage of
many of the key benefits of Python and is totally in the spirit of
Python.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This excerpt from the Httpdapy README file describes well the
challenges and the solution provided by embedding Python within the
HTTP server:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>While developing my first WWW applications a few years back, I
found that using CGI for programs that need to connect to
relational databases (commercial or not) is too slow because every
hit requires loading of the interpreter executable which can be
megabytes in size, any database libraries that can themselves be
pretty big, plus, the database connection/authentication process
carries a very significant overhead because it involves things like
DNS resolutions, encryption, memory allocation, etc.. Under
pressure to speed up the application, I nearly gave up the idea of
using Python for the project and started researching other tools
that claimed to specialize in www database integration. I did not
have any faith in MS&#39;s ASP; was quite frustrated by Netscape
LiveWire&#39;s slow performance and bugginess; Cold Fusion seemed
promising, but I soon learned that writing in html-like tags makes
programs as readable as assembly. Same is true for PHP. Besides, I
*really* wanted to write things in Python.

Around the same time the Internet Programming With Python book came
out and the chapter describing how to embed Python within Netscape
server immediately caught my attention.  I used the example in my
project, and developed an improved version of what I later called
Nsapy that compiled on both Windows NT and Solaris.

Although Nsapy only worked with Netscape servers, it was a very
intelligent generic OO design that, in the spirit of Python, that
lent itself for easy portability to other web servers.

Incidently, the popularity of Netscape&#39;s servers was taking a turn
south, and so I set out to port Nsapy to other servers starting
with the most popular one, Apache. And so from Nsapy was born
Httpdapy.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>...continuing this saga, yours truly later learned that writing
Httpdapy for every server is a task a little bigger and less
interesting than I originally imagined.</p>
<p>Instead, it seemed like providing a Python counterpart to the popular
Perl Apache extension mod_perl that would give Python users the same
(or better) capability would be a much more exciting thing to do.</p>
<p>And so it was done. The first release of mod_python happened in May of
2000.</p>
